## Description

The Landing Page Project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a landing page with dynamic functionality. It consists of multiple sections, each represented by a distinct area on the page. The navigation menu is dynamically generated based on the sections defined in the HTML file. When a navigation item is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section. Additionally, as the user scrolls through the page, the active section in the viewport is highlighted in the navigation menu.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The landing page will be displayed, featuring a navigation menu at the top and multiple sections below. Clicking on any navigation item will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section on the page. As you scroll through the page, the active section in the viewport will be highlighted in the navigation menu.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve its functionality.
